# Competitive Research — accepted.fyi

*Last updated: February 2026*

## Executive Summary

No existing platform combines: crowdsourced individual admissions outcomes + structured/filterable database + holistic applicant profiles (GPA, test scores, ECs, background) + free access + cross-school aggregation + verification tiers. This is the gap accepted.fyi fills.

## Direct Competitors

### 1. CollegeVine
- **What it does**: AI-powered "chancing engine" that predicts admission probability based on student profile. Also offers essay review and Q&A community.
- **Pricing**: Free (chancing), paid for essay review and consulting
- **Data type**: Algorithmic predictions based on institutional aggregate data (NOT individual outcomes)
- **Crowdsourced?** No. Uses institutional data + proprietary model
- **Verified?** N/A (no user-submitted outcomes)
- **Key weakness**: Chancing is notoriously inaccurate, especially for selective schools. Cannot factor in essays, recommendations, or interviews. Overestimates chances. Major selection shows inflated chances for majors that don't exist at certain schools (e.g., business at Harvard). Users on College Confidential and Reddit widely criticize accuracy.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Real outcomes from real students vs. algorithmic guesses. "Here's what actually happened" vs. "here's what we think might happen."

### 2. AdmitSee (YC-backed)
- **What it does**: Crowdsourced database of real college application materials (essays, profiles) from admitted students. 250K+ students served.
- **Pricing**: Freemium — $30/month or $200/year for full access. Individual profile views $5-15.
- **Data type**: Individual self-reported profiles with essays
- **Crowdsourced?** Yes — students upload applications
- **Verified?** Minimal — self-reported, no tiered verification
- **Key weakness**: Essay-focused, not outcomes-focused. Paywalled. No structured data for filtering/comparison (can't filter by "show me all Stanford acceptees with 1450-1550 SAT"). No aggregate statistics. No cross-school comparison. Expensive for the target demographic (high schoolers).
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Free access model (post to view). Structured, filterable data. Focus on outcomes + stats, not essays. Aggregate school-level analytics. Verification tiers.

### 3. AdmitYogi (Stanford student startup)
- **What it does**: Catalog of thousands of successful college applications. Students upload profiles, others pay to view. Also has AI essay tools and a "ChanceMe" calculator.
- **Pricing**: $5-15 per profile view. Uploaders get 50% of revenue.
- **Data type**: Individual profiles with full application materials
- **Crowdsourced?** Yes — pay-to-view model
- **Verified?** Minimal
- **Key weakness**: Pay-per-view model limits access. Focused on "successful" applications only (survivorship bias). No structured data for filtering. Small scale compared to AdmitSee. Revenue-share model may limit data quality.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Free. Shows ALL outcomes (rejected, waitlisted, deferred), not just acceptances. Structured + filterable. Verification tiers.

### 4. College Results App (collegeresults.app)
- **What it does**: Find college application results from students with similar profiles. AI-powered essay tools, chancing calculator, AI admissions advisor.
- **Pricing**: Unknown (requires login)
- **Data type**: Crowdsourced individual outcomes
- **Crowdsourced?** Yes
- **Verified?** Unknown
- **Key weakness**: Small, unknown scale. AI-heavy features may dilute the core data value. Requires login to see anything. No public brand recognition.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Public aggregate data for SEO. Verification tiers. School-level analytics. Decision timeline tracking. Shareable decision cards for viral growth.

### 5. CollegeData Admissions Tracker
- **What it does**: Students self-report application stats and outcomes in a tracker format.
- **Pricing**: Free
- **Data type**: Individual self-reported outcomes
- **Crowdsourced?** Yes
- **Verified?** No
- **Key weakness**: Legacy UX (looks like it's from 2008). No modern filtering. No aggregate analytics. No verification. Owned by 1st Financial Bank — not a tech company. Data quality questionable. Limited user base.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Modern UX. Aggregate analytics. Verification tiers. Institutional data alongside crowdsourced data. Active growth strategy.

---

## Community/Forum Platforms

### 6. Reddit r/ApplyingToCollege
- **What it does**: 650K+ member subreddit. Decision reaction megathreads per school. "Chance me" posts. Results sharing.
- **Pricing**: Free
- **Data type**: Unstructured individual posts
- **Crowdsourced?** Yes, but chaotic
- **Verified?** No
- **Key weakness**: Data is unstructured, unsearchable, ephemeral. Buried in comment threads. No filtering. No aggregation. Toxic "chance me" culture. No verification — anyone can post anything.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Structured, permanent, searchable, filterable version of what r/A2C does in chaotic comment threads. This is the single biggest pitch: "We're the structured database for the data people already share on Reddit."

### 7. College Confidential
- **What it does**: Legacy forum (22M+ posts) for college admissions discussion. School-specific "Results" threads. "Chance me" forums.
- **Pricing**: Free (ad-supported). Owned by Hobsons, ~700 colleges advertise.
- **Data type**: Unstructured forum posts
- **Crowdsourced?** Yes, decades of data
- **Verified?** No
- **Key weakness**: Extremely outdated UX. Toxic reputation. Data buried in forums, unsearchable. Declining user base (Reddit + Discord taking over). Ad-heavy experience. No structured data export.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Modern, structured, beautiful. Same data people share on CC, but searchable and filterable. No ads. Clean UX.

## School-Licensed / Institutional Tools

### 8. Naviance (by PowerSchool)
- **What it does**: School counseling platform with a "scattergram" feature showing GPA vs. test score outcomes for students from YOUR specific high school.
- **Pricing**: Licensed to schools (~$5-20 per student). Students don't pay directly.
- **Data type**: Individual outcomes, but locked to your own high school
- **Crowdsourced?** Yes, within each school silo
- **Verified?** School-verified (counselors enter data)
- **Key weakness**: Siloed per school — you can ONLY see outcomes from your own high school. If your school has 100 seniors, you might see 2-3 data points for any given college. Useless for small schools. No cross-school comparison. Students at schools without Naviance get nothing.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Cross-school aggregation. Anyone can contribute regardless of their high school. 1000x more data per college than any single school's Naviance.

### 9. Scoir
- **What it does**: College planning and application management platform. School-licensed with student-facing features.
- **Pricing**: School-licensed (B2B)
- **Data type**: Institutional + some student data
- **Crowdsourced?** No — school-managed
- **Verified?** School-verified
- **Key weakness**: Same silo problem as Naviance. No cross-school data. Students only have access through their school.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Direct-to-student. No school license required. Cross-school data.

---

## College Search / Matching Tools

### 10. Niche.com
- **What it does**: School reviews, rankings, and college search. 15,000+ school clients. Massive SEO presence.
- **Pricing**: Free for students. Revenue from college advertising, lead gen, and sponsored listings.
- **Data type**: Aggregate institutional data + student reviews (qualitative)
- **Crowdsourced?** Reviews are crowdsourced, but admissions data is institutional
- **Verified?** No individual outcome verification
- **Key weakness**: Reviews are qualitative, not quantitative. No individual admissions outcomes. Rankings are opinion-based. Heavy ad/sponsorship model means schools that pay rank higher.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Quantitative individual outcomes, not qualitative reviews. No pay-to-rank. Structured data that answers "will I get in?" not "do students like it here?"

### 11. Appily (formerly Cappex, owned by EAB)
- **What it does**: All-in-one college planning: search 4,000+ schools, virtual tours, 250K scholarships, college matching, direct admission offers.
- **Pricing**: Free for students. Revenue from institutional partnerships.
- **Data type**: Aggregate institutional data. No individual outcomes.
- **Crowdsourced?** No
- **Verified?** N/A
- **Key weakness**: Discovery-focused, not outcomes-focused. Tells you about schools, but not "what stats get people in." No individual outcome data. Lead-gen business model (sells student data to colleges).
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Outcomes-focused. "Here's what it actually takes to get in" vs. "here are schools you might like."

### 12. BigFuture (College Board)
- **What it does**: College Board's official college search and planning tool. Uses SAT data + institutional data.
- **Pricing**: Free
- **Data type**: Aggregate institutional data from College Board
- **Crowdsourced?** No
- **Verified?** Institutional data is verified
- **Key weakness**: Boring, institutional feel. No individual outcomes. Limited to what College Board publishes. No community. Conflict of interest (College Board profits from SAT, so tool emphasizes test scores).
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Individual outcomes. Community-driven. Holistic profiles beyond just test scores. No conflicts of interest.

## Calculators / Chancing Tools

### 13. PrepScholar Admissions Calculator
- **What it does**: Enter GPA + SAT, get acceptance probability for any school.
- **Pricing**: Free calculator. Revenue from paid SAT/ACT prep courses.
- **Data type**: Algorithmic predictions from aggregate institutional data (only GPA + SAT)
- **Crowdsourced?** No
- **Verified?** N/A
- **Key weakness**: Only uses GPA and SAT — ignores extracurriculars, essays, recommendations, demographics, everything that matters for holistic admissions. Wildly inconsistent with other calculators (e.g., Northeastern shows as "safety" on PrepScholar, 10% chance on Niche). Primarily a funnel for selling test prep courses.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Real outcomes with 20+ data fields per submission. Shows the full picture, not just GPA/SAT.

---

## AI Admissions Advisors (New Wave)

### 14. Ultra (YC-backed, 2025)
- **What it does**: "Advisor for Ambitious Students." AI-powered admissions coaching with chance-me predictions and profile reviews by former admissions officers. LinkedIn for high schoolers.
- **Pricing**: Unknown (appears to have free + premium tiers)
- **Data type**: AI-powered, likely uses institutional data
- **Crowdsourced?** Not primarily
- **Verified?** N/A
- **Key weakness**: Consulting/coaching play, not a data platform. Aimed at "ambitious" students — doesn't democratize access. No structured outcome database. AI advice, not real data.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Data-first, not advice-first. Free and open. Democratizes access (not just for "ambitious" students). Community-driven.

### 15. Empowerly
- **What it does**: AI-augmented admissions counseling platform. Raised $15M (TechCrunch, Feb 2024). Offers "Empowerly Score" technology, essay editing, counselor matching.
- **Pricing**: $5,000+ for comprehensive packages. Some users report $1,600-$9,000.
- **Data type**: Proprietary AI + counselor expertise
- **Crowdsourced?** No
- **Verified?** N/A
- **Key weakness**: Extremely expensive ($5K-9K). Inaccessible to most families. Consulting model, not a data platform. No community-driven data.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Free. Data-driven rather than counselor-driven. Accessible to everyone, not just wealthy families.

---

## Government/Institutional Data Sources

### 16. College Scorecard (US Dept of Education)
- **What it does**: Free government tool with institutional-level data: acceptance rates, SAT/ACT ranges, graduation rates, post-graduation earnings.
- **Pricing**: Free. Open API.
- **Data type**: Aggregate institutional data from federal reporting
- **Crowdsourced?** No — institutional reporting
- **Verified?** Yes (federal reporting requirements)
- **Key weakness**: No individual outcomes. Salary data biased (only covers students who received federal aid). No program-specific admissions data. Aggregate only — can't answer "what stats get people in?" Data is 1-2 years old by publication. No UX — just raw data.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: accepted.fyi should INGEST College Scorecard data as the institutional baseline, then layer crowdsourced individual outcomes on top. Best of both worlds.

### 17. Common Data Set (CDS)
- **What it does**: Standardized annual survey that most colleges complete voluntarily. Includes detailed admissions statistics, enrollment demographics, financial aid data.
- **Pricing**: Free (published as PDFs by each school)
- **Data type**: Aggregate institutional data
- **Crowdsourced?** No
- **Verified?** Self-reported by institutions
- **Key weakness**: Published as PDFs — not machine-readable. Each school's CDS is on a different webpage. No central searchable database. Requires manually finding and reading 100+ page documents. 1-year lag.
- **How accepted.fyi differentiates**: Parse CDS data and make it searchable + comparable alongside crowdsourced individual data.

## Key Strategic Insight (for YC)

A PNAS study found that high-achieving students exposed to Naviance scattergrams were **50% less likely to apply to elite colleges**. Existing tools actively DISCOURAGE ambition through incomplete data. accepted.fyi, by showing full holistic profiles alongside outcomes, can show that students with "non-standard" profiles DO get in — countering the reductive GPA+SAT narrative.

---

## Key Takeaway: The Gap

**Nobody combines institutional data + crowdsourced individual outcomes + structured filtering + free access + verification in one platform.**

- AdmitSee is closest but is paywalled and essay-focused
- CollegeVine has good UX but uses algorithmic predictions, not real data
- Naviance has verified data but is siloed per school
- Reddit has the most organic data sharing but it's chaotic and unstructured
- College Scorecard has the best institutional data but no individual outcomes

accepted.fyi's moat: **Institutional baseline (College Scorecard/CDS) + crowdsourced individual outcomes (like a structured r/A2C) + 3-tier verification + free access (post to view) + beautiful UX.** This combination does not exist.
